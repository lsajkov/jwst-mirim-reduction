    "- Using this notebook requires downloading and installing the Crab reduction toolkit (linked above, or at: https://github.com/1054/Crab.Toolkit.JWST/). The notebook was built on toolkit version v20230109_before_huge_mosaic, downloaded May 22, 2024.\n",
    "- Besides the Crab redution toolkit, this notebook also requries two pieces of code:\n",
    "    - med_filt_and_sup_bkg_sub.py = code for median filering and super background subtraction;\n",
    "    - post_reduction_steps.py = code for sorting reduced data and creating TA box cutouts.\n",
